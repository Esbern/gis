 This note uses a simple counting of people, cars, bikes, etc. and is primarily inspired by the text [[How to Study Public Life]] 
 As Gehl puts it:
 >In principle, everything can be counted, but what is often registered is how many people are moving (pedestrian flow) and how many are staying in one place (stationary activity).
However, the counting process is not as simple as it seems. It involves several crucial considerations, including the 'when' and the 'where ', as well as the vital role of categorization in determining what we are counting. 
	
When to count?
Public life changes constantly in the course of a day, week, or month and over the years.
