 **Introduction**

The GL Transmission Format (glTF) is an open-standard file format designed for efficient transmission and loading of 3D models and scenes. Developed by the Khronos Group, glTF is often referred to as the "JPEG of 3D" due to its focus on minimizing the size of 3D assets and enabling fast loading and rendering. Its efficiency and wide support make it an ideal choice for visualizing complex urban environments in web and application contexts.

**What glTF Contains**

glTF is a versatile format that encapsulates a wide range of 3D data:

- **Geometry**: Includes mesh data such as vertices, normals, and texture coordinates.
- **Materials**: Supports physically-based rendering (PBR) materials for realistic surface appearances.
- **Textures**: Embeds or references external image files for surface detailing.
- **Animations**: Contains keyframe animations for meshes and skeletal animations for characters.
- **Scene Graph**: Defines the hierarchy and organization of objects within a scene.
- **Cameras and Lights**: Includes camera views and lighting information (in glTF 2.0 extensions).
- **Extensions**: Allows for custom data and features beyond the core specification, such as skinning and morph targets.

The format comes in two primary versions:

- **glTF (JSON)**: Consists of a JSON file (.gltf) with external binary data and textures.
- **Binary glTF (glb)**: A single binary file (.glb) that packs JSON content, binary data, and textures together.

**Creating glTF Files**

Creating glTF assets involves several steps and tools, especially when focusing on urban environments:

1. **3D Modeling Software**
