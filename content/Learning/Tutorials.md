After creating hundreds and watching thousands of tutorials, I must admit I am not a great fan of classical tutorials. After watching and perhaps successfully completing a tutorial, the problem of transfer arises: how to transfer the knowledge from the tutorial to your own domain and pondering over questions like why does this step not work with my data? a process that does not generate much knowledge. I prefer a two-stage approach, first describing a theoretical path of operations to perform in order to achieve a given task and then having a description of how the general operations can be performed in a given software. This is also my motivation for creating this digital garden.
There are, however, two concepts that can be seen as rather similar to tutorials that I do endorse, and they are lectures and demos. 
	- Lectures. Lectures are theoretical presentations od how a given problem can be addressed. The focus more on the theoretical steps to solve a given type of problem 
	- Demos. Demos demonstrate how a software-specific operation can be performed
