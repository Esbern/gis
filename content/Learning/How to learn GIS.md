## Breaking Out of the Tutorial Trap
Most learning resources out there stick to the same old formula: watch a bunch of tutorials and hope something sticks. But let’s be honest—how often does that really work? 
While tutorials can give a sense of quick progress, the problem is that all too common educational problems transfer. i.e. the ability to transfer what you have learned in one context to another, and the most tutorials fail miserably. 

**The problem of learning a skill**
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice, there is.

#### Ultra-Learning: Dive Deep, Learn Fast

With ultra-learning, you’re in the driver’s seat. It’s all about intense, focused, and self-directed learning. Instead of passively watching videos, you’ll dive right into hands-on tasks, challenge yourself with projects, and focus on getting real feedback from your peers. Here’s what you’ll do:

* **Set Clear Goals**: Know what you want to achieve and go after it with laser focus.
* **Learn by Doing**: Jump straight into practical tasks rather than just watching others do it.
* **Regular Practice**: Identify your weak spots and practice them until they’re strengths.
* **Test Yourself**: Keep testing your knowledge to make sure it sticks.
* **Seek Feedback**: Get constructive criticism to improve your work.
* **Retain Information**: Use techniques like spaced repetition to remember.

#### POPL: Tackle Real-World Problems

Problem-Oriented Project Learning means you won’t just be learning for the sake of it. You’ll work on projects that reflect actual challenges you might face in your professional life. Here’s how it works:
  
* **Real-World Projects**: Choose projects that matter to you and your work.
* **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Break down each project into manageable steps, from understanding the problem to presenting your findings.
* **Collaborate**: Work with peers, share insights, and learn together.
* **Document Your Process**: Keep track of your work and explain your design rationales—why you made certain decisions and how they impact the outcome.

#### A clear and well-defined design rational
When working with problems of any complexity, having a clear and well-defined design rationale is paramount, not least to document any design decisions but also to enable others to give qualified feedback relating to:
* A clear statement of objectives
* Reasoning behind decisions
* Clear overview of alternatives

#### Digital Garden: Learn What You Need, When You Need It

Think of our site as a digital garden. It’s a space where ideas grow and connect organically. Instead of following a rigid path, you can start with a specific problem you need to solve and explore the concepts as they relate to that problem. Here’s what makes it special:

* **Non-Linear Learning**: Jump in wherever it makes sense for you. Need to solve a specific issue? Start there and see where it takes you.
* **Interconnected Notes**: Explore topics through a web of interconnected notes and resources, making it easy to dive deeper as needed.
* **Personal Growth**: Cultivate your knowledge over time, adding to your understanding bit by bit.
