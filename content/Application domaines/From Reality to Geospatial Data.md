 The purpose of this [[This site is a Digital Garden#Map of Contents (MOC)|MOC]] is to guide you through what can seem a rather daunting journey from "reality" to geospatial data. 
 Before starting on this journey, it is important to understand the basics of geospatial modelling of reality.
## Basic principals of geospatial modelling of Reality
 
The two basic principles for the representation of geospatial data are :
 - [[Entity-based modelling]].
 - [[Field-based modelling]].
 As we move on down the winding way to representing reality using geospatial data, it is important to remember these basic principles of modelling. It is also important to remember that although they might seem mutually excluding, it is often a design choice which principal to choose. For instance, terrain as elevation over sea level can be represented as a **continuous field** or as discrete **entities** such as hills,  plateaus and walls, each with an attribute defining the elevation over sea level.
## Defining the world of observation
Talking about reality is always scary, for what is reality? Instead of trying to define "reality" that has so many everyday meanings, we will substitute the term "reality" with the term "[[world of observation]]", thereby enabling us to focus on defining the aspects relevant to the context of geospatial data.
