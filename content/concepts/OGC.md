The Open Geospatial Consortium, or in common terms, OGC, is, according to their website, " a consortium of experts committed to improving access to geospatial, or location information. We connect people, communities, and technology to solve global challenges and address everyday needs". They also state "We are an international membership organization that supports a diverse community of businesses, government agencies, research organizations, and universities, all working together to make location information FAIR â€“ Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable".
In praxis, this means maintaining the public geospatial formats, the OGC standards. An OGC can be developed by a member organisation such as ESRI or Google and made public and endorsed by OGC. A list of the OGC standards can be seen on https://www.ogc.org/standards/
