n EPSG code is a unique identifier assigned by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) originally named “European Petroleum Survey Group” (ESPG) to a specific coordinate reference system (CRS) or coordinate transformation. Setting a CRS in a given software is often easier using the short ESPG code rather than spelling the full name of the CRS for instance, 25832 is the ESPG code for "ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N" or written without the abbreviation "European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 /Universal Transversal Mercator zone 32 North"
