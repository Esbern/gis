Welcome to my digital garden of **[[GIS]]** and other geospatial technologies. I have created hundreds of GIS tutorial videos and tried to organise them into nicely structured websites. Still, I have never really been happy with this way of sharing my knowledge of GIS and other geospatial technologies. I have therefore decided to try another approach to sharing my knowledge, namely a digital garden.  This digital garden is a public web-based semi-curated view of my personal notes on GIS and other geospatial technologies. Some notes are created as learning resources entirely with the purpose of sharing knowledge, while other notes are created as tools in my personal learning process. 

If it is your first time on the site, please read:
- [[My thoughts on learning GIS]].
- [[Integrating Generative AI]].
- [[This site is a Digital Garden]].
- [[Navigating the site]].

If you are ready to explore the garden, jump to one of the Maps of Content (MOCs) in the [[Map of Content Collection|collection]] or directly to one of the base MOCs
