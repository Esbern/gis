In this note, I will link to the skills needed to create your first (Not so much focus on design) Map using QGIS.

Prerequisites:
Have downloaded and installed QGIS. See [[QGIS#Installing QGIS.]]
Have access to a "[[Basemap]]" of the area you want to include for your first map. See [[Working with Basemaps in QGIS]]
