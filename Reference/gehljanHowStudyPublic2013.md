> abstract:: by Jan Gehl, Birgitte Svarre., English, Translation of the author's Bylivsstudier, originally published in Danish., How do we accommodate a growing urban population in a way that is sustainable, equitable, and inviting? This question is becoming increasingly urgent to answer as we face diminishing fossil-fuel resources and the effects of a changing climate while global cities continue to compete to be the most vibrant centers of culture, knowledge, and finance. Jan Gehl has been examining this question since the 1960s, when few urban designers or planners were thinking about designing cities for people. But given the unpredictable, complex and ephemeral nature of life in cities, how can we best design public infrastructure—vital to cities for getting from place to place, or staying in place—for human use? Studying city life and understanding the factors that encourage or discourage use is the key to designing inviting public space. In How to Study Public Life Jan Gehl and Birgitte Svarre draw from their combined experience of over 50 years to provide a history of public-life study as well as methods and tools necessary to recapture city life as an important planning dimension. This type of systematic study began in earnest in the 1960s, when several researchers and journalists on different continents criticized urban planning for having forgotten life in the city. City life studies provide knowledge about human behavior in the built environment in an attempt to put it on an equal footing with knowledge about urban elements such as buildings and transport systems. Studies can be used as input in the decision-making process,  as part of overall planning, or in designing individual projects such as streets, squares or parks. The original goal is still the goal today: to recapture city life as an important planning dimension. Anyone interested in improving city life will find inspiration, tools, and examples in this invaluable guide.

> Good architecture ensures good interaction between public space and public life. But while architects and urban planners have been dealing with space, the other side of the coin – life – has often been forgotten

> Public life changes constantly in the course of a day, week, or month, and over the years. In addition, design, gender, age, financial resources, culture and many other factors determine how we use or do not use public space. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=2&annotation=3H9FFWED))
> In this context, public space is understood as streets, alleys, buildings, squares, bollards: everything that can be considered part of the built environment. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=2&annotation=52QUDQVA))
> Public life should also be understood in the broadest sense as everything that takes place between buildings, to and from school, on balconies, seated, standing, walking, biking, etc 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=5&annotation=ACICRANZ))
> Anyone who decides to observe life in the city will quickly realize that you have to be systematic in order to get useful knowledge from the complex confusion of life in public space. Perhaps the person being observed is actually running an errand, but takes time to look at other people along the way, or catches sight of a protest march in the street that becomes all engrossing. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=5&annotation=VFRDUAKU))
> In general, the observer must be as neutral as the proverbial 'fly on the wall' – the party’s benchwarmer rather than its lion, an invisible non-participant who takes in the big picture without taking part in the event. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=5&annotation=JNSQSBLY))
> An observer can play various roles depending on the character of the study. The role of registrar, for example, counting units, where precision is the most important function. The registrar can also have an assessment role, categorizing people by age group, for example. Here the ability to evaluate is the most important function. Or the registrar’s role can be analytical, keeping a detailed diary with a feeling for nuance, a trained eye and experienced sense of what type of information is relevant.

> 6 city life and space with their own eyes, because it provides greater understanding. We believe this is still the critical starting point for going into the city to observe, using one’s senses, common sense and simple registration techniques with pen and paper, which is why we emphasize these manual methods. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=6&annotation=5TX6G4YI))
> In using these manual methods, the observer is the human factor for good and ill. Technical solutions such as video surveillance cameras or GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking devices can sometimes serve as more objective solutions. The decision must be made as to the degree of precision needed and the form of knowledge wanted.

> An automatic bicycle counter is set up on a bike path to count passing bikers. One day almost no bicyclists are registered. What the human registrar can see is that a van is parked on the bike path a few feet ahead of the automatic counter, so on that day the bicyclists veer around the counter.

> Usually quite a number of counts have to be made in order to be able to compare different times of day, different days and different seasons. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=13&annotation=PRGPEQVA))
> A number on its own is seldom of interest. It is important that results can be compared. Therefore, it is essential to register precisely and comparably. Factual conditions like weather and time of day must also be noted consistently and precisely so that similar studies can be conducted at a later date.

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=13&annotation=BCGUX7SU))
> In principle, everything can be counted, but what is often registered is how many people are moving (pedestrian flow) and how many are staying in one place (stationary activity). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=14&annotation=CLU92EKR))
> Question 2. Who?

> It is often relevant to be more specific about precisely who uses various public spaces. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=14&annotation=GMIUK62I))
> While registration can be done on the individual level, it is often more meaningful to investigate more general categories such as gender or age. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=14&annotation=ZXSL3UTI))
> Basic knowledge about the behavior of various groups of people can be used to plan more precise ways of accommodating the needs of women, children, the elderly and disabled, for example. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=14&annotation=VX54U5YB))
> The general question of gender and age can be registered by observation, naturally allowing for a certain degree of inaccuracy in making a subjective evaluation of age group. It is difficult or impossible to categorize people with respect to job or economic situation, for example, on the basis of observation alone.

> Planners and architects can design public space on the basis of where people are expected to go and to stay. However, many trampled footpaths across otherwise pristine lawns attest to the fact that people do not always act as intended. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=15&annotation=BGVQGRIJ))
> Studies of movement and staying can help uncover barriers and pinpoint where pedestrian paths and places to stay can be laid out.

> In general, public space activities can be divided into two categories: necessary and optional.

> Basic knowledge about how long various activities last can qualify the work of orienting selected public spaces toward inviting people for longer periods of staying while allowing other spaces to have a transient character.

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=22&annotation=VL4PFKNV))
> Since good weather provides the best conditions for outdoor public life, registrations are usually made on days with good weather for the time of year 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=22&annotation=VDTVF3JR))
> The weather is particularly sensitive for registering stays, because even if inclement weather clears up, people do not sit on wet benches, and if it feels like rain, most people are reluctant to find a seat

> Automated registration makes it possible to process large amounts of data. It does not require the same manpower to conduct observations, but does require investments in equipment as well as in manpower to process the data collected. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=23&annotation=WK26FKAA))
> Therefore, the choice of manual or automated method is often dependent on the size of the study and the price of the equipment. Much of the technical equipment is either not very common or in an early stage of development, which makes it even more relevant to consider the advantages and disadvantages. However, it is likely that automated registration will play a more prominent role in public life studies in future.

> Counting Tracing Test walks Mapping Tracking Photographing Looking for traces Keeping a diary Counting is a widely used tool in public life studies. In principle, everything can be counted, which provides numbers for making comparisons before and after, between different geographic areas or over time. People’s movements inside or crossing a limited space can be drawn as lines of movement on a plan of the area being studied. Taking a walk while observing the surrounding life can be more or less systematic, but the aim is that the observer has a chance to notice problems and potentials for city life on a given route. Activities, people, places for staying and much more can be plotted in, that is, drawn as symbols on a plan of an area being studied to mark the number and type of activities and where they take place. This is also called behavioral mapping. In order to observe people’s movements over a large area or for a longer time, observers can discreetly follow people without their knowing it or follow someone who knows and agrees to be followed and observed. This is also called shadowing. Photographing is an essential part of public life studies to document situations where urban life and form either interact or fail to interact after initiatives have been taken. Human activity often leaves traces such as litter in the streets, dirt patches on grass etc., which gives the observer information about the city life. These traces can be registered through counting, photograping or mapping. Keeping a diary can register details and nuances about the interaction between public life and space, noting observations that can later be categorized and/or quantified.

> Counting is basic to public life studies. In principle, everything can be counted: number of people, gender division, how many people are talking to each other, how many are smiling, how many are walking alone or in groups, how many are active, how many are talking on their cell phones, how many shop windows have metal bars after closing, how many banks there are, and so on. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AL9UCLNH?page=25&annotation=W2JDRMQG))
> Numbers can be registered using a handheld counter or by simply making marks on a piece of paper when people walk past an imaginary line. If the goal is to count people staying, the observer typically walks around the space and does a headcount.

> Naturally, it is crucial to conduct the count for exactly ten minutes, because this is a random sample that will later have to be repeated in order to calculate pedestrian traffic per hour. All of the individual hours will then be compiled in order to get an overview of the day. Therefore, even small inaccuracies can invalidate the results.
