> abstract:: In this article, I review considerations and techniques for approaching cartographic design as visual storytelling. Stories, like maps, are a method for documenting and explaining, for meaningfully abstracting our experiences, for communicating and sharing, and for asserting a particular worldview. I argue that visual storytelling oÔ¨Äers an entry point for hybridization in cartography, uniting technology with praxis, product with process, and design with critique while opening rich new avenues for transdisciplinary research and design. I begin by introducing inÔ¨Çuences on map-based visual storytelling and review ten recurring themes that make visual storytelling diÔ¨Äerent from traditional perspectives on cartographic design. I then oÔ¨Äer three of potentially many ways to articulate and organize the design space for mapbased visual storytelling: foundational narrative elements and their adaptation to geographic phenomena and processes, visual storytelling genres delineating diÔ¨Äerent story experiences, and visual storytelling tropes used to advance narratives across text, maps, images, and other multimedia. I conclude with a call for future research on visual storytelling in cartography, including visual design, visual ethics, and visual literacy.
