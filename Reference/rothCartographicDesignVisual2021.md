> abstract:: In this article, I review considerations and techniques for approaching cartographic design as visual storytelling. Stories, like maps, are a method for documenting and explaining, for meaningfully abstracting our experiences, for communicating and sharing, and for asserting a particular worldview. I argue that visual storytelling oﬀers an entry point for hybridization in cartography, uniting technology with praxis, product with process, and design with critique while opening rich new avenues for transdisciplinary research and design. I begin by introducing inﬂuences on map-based visual storytelling and review ten recurring themes that make visual storytelling diﬀerent from traditional perspectives on cartographic design. I then oﬀer three of potentially many ways to articulate and organize the design space for mapbased visual storytelling: foundational narrative elements and their adaptation to geographic phenomena and processes, visual storytelling genres delineating diﬀerent story experiences, and visual storytelling tropes used to advance narratives across text, maps, images, and other multimedia. I conclude with a call for future research on visual storytelling in cartography, including visual design, visual ethics, and visual literacy.

> interest in narrative and storytelling is not new to cartography, as many of the most celebrated maps from antiquity worked not because they were accurate or complete, but because they aligned with a dominant oral tradition or cultural narrative (Woodward and Harley, 1987; Crampton, 2011).

> I present ten common themes in visual storytelling with maps. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=HE75UI35))
> 1. Designed: Making a visual story, much like making a map, is a deliberate process that draws on the designer’s understanding of and interests in the represented phenomena and target audience (Pearce, 2008). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=Y2KAHM67))
> the goal of visual storytelling is not just to ‘show’ but also to ‘explain’ (Tufte, 1997) 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=VFN5WDDW))
> 2. Partial: Visual stories prioritize essential information needed to follow the narrative, often emphasizing a small set of key characters, places, and events while ignoring others. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=DKDF4LB6))
> However, Cronon ( 1992: 1349) warns that ‘in the act of separating story from non-story, we wield the most powerful yet dangerous tool of the narrative form,’ calling into question whose voices are heard in the story and whose are not. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=NE5CR3DH))
> 3. Intuitive: For many, visual stories are more grokable than other modes of communication, offering a more approachable way to mix hard numbers with anecdotal descriptions (Gershon and Page, 2001). That visual stories are partial abstractions generally makes them easier to understand due to reduced information complexity 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=KBI8I8LQ))
> 4. Compelling: Not just intuitive, visual stories also are considered a more meaningful way to communicate a message, offering a deep, contextualized account versus a superficial, sanitized overview (Macfarlane, 2007). Visual stories often capture our attention through a vivid array of graphics, images, and other multimedia, that, when combined with maps, develop a richer sense of place than vector linework alone (Cartwright, 1999).

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 85](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=85&annotation=VC553QM8))
> 5. Relatable: Visual stories promote empathy; the audience puts themselves into the story setting, assumes the roles of the characters, and draws from personal experience to add context (Gershon and Page, 2001). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=M8YAXQW6))
> 6. Memorable: Visual stories – through their intuitive, compelling, and relatable designs – tie seemingly unrelated information together in a memorable way through logical continuity (van Elzakker, 1993; Kosara and Mackinlay, 2013). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=YTCQX4EK))
> Story maps and geoweb technologies capture memories as traces through the landscape, providing a record of where we have been and thus who we are becoming (Tasker, 1999 in Caquard and Cartwright, 2014). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=UGBER45M))
> But visual stories do not just capture memories, they also shape them. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=28FZI2C7))
> 7. Situated: Visual stories present meaning from a grounded perspective (Pearce, 2014), from ‘somewhere’ and ‘someone’ in contrast to the objective view from ‘nowhere’ and ‘no one’ often assumed in cartography and related design fields 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=QCY95HSX))
> First, visual storytelling invites designers to be reflexive about their positionality and subjectivity (Ricker, 2017; Kelly, 2019). Just as data cannot speak for themselves (Gould, 1981), stories cannot tell themselves, and stories that include the designer’s voice in the telling can be more compelling and relatable 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=7G5XWTS6))
> 8. Persuasive: Visual stories do not only ‘explain’, they also ‘argue’ from their situated positions (Harley, 1989). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=BWKQNXN6))
> Accordingly, it is necessary to question if such persuasive visual storytelling without an accompanying visual ethics is doing more harm than good to our collective geographic understanding and global citizenship (Kent, 2017). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=LWMTTCIS))
> 9. Political: That visual stories are partial, situated, and persuasive also means they are inherently political, exercising power by promoting particular voices and interpretations while obscuring others 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=6HCKJL95))
> 10. Fluid: Finally, the meanings of visual stories – both those intended by the designer and interpreted by the audience – are not static, and change across cultures and through time (Pearce, 2014). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=86&annotation=WPJGKSIN))
> Maps do not tell stories in themselves, but instead ‘stories are thrust upon the map’ (Denil, 2017: 19) 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=87&annotation=5H9346YG))
> describe the design space for visual storytelling is by the narrative sequence used in the story. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=87&annotation=SC4KYLTM))
> sequence typically is defined by the temporal order of events, 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=87&annotation=RVIL3TM2))
> However, maps and other visualizations using a spatial metaphor are inherently two-dimensional and thus often lack a temporal sequence or relevant linear axis to inform a plotline (Mocnik and Fairbairn, 2018). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=87&annotation=4ALF5GDT))
> Therefore, the designer must select narrative elements and enforce linearity in the reading of the visual story (Gershon and Page, 2001; Hullman et al.,2013).

> Problem context draws from ancillary or supplemental geospatial datasets to describe contingent information about the characters, setting, and their activities, as well as the broader story purpose and theme. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=88&annotation=U5IKTEAR))

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=88&annotation=LN2PFW4V))
> Finally, the set-up often includes a hook, or an early scene (i.e., the ‘teaser’ or ‘click-bait’) that captures attention and builds buy-in from the audience (Kosara and Mackinlay, 2013; Roth, 2015).

> A three-act narrative then progresses into the conflict, introducing the problem, building tension, and incrementally advancing the plot (Fontaine, 2015).

> For story maps, a plot point can be a single ‘point’ on the map, symbolized and annotated to fit within the linear narrative, or a stand-alone map ‘plot’, sequenced within a series of maps and graphic panels. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=599JWB8X))
> A three-act narrative ends with the resolution, bringing the narrative arc to its culminating moment and presenting concluding (re)solutions to the problem 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=2QEE35HP))
> the climax again helps the audience assume multiple perspectives, enriching their understanding of how solutions to the problem will have a differential impact on people and places. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=94NBA54D))
> Like the hook, visuals also can be interactive for the climax, with the maps and visualizations not provided to gain an initial overview through exploration (as in the hook), but instead to directly interrogate competing scenarios and outcomes at the most critical point in the narrative arc (Proulx et al.,2006). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=HWWKCZLQ))
> Following the climax, the designer may choose to impose a single solution, arguing for one interpretation of the story – and thus of the mapped information – over others. This rhetorical structure connecting evidence to a central claim is common in data journalism, 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=BHNZWE4K))
> Arguably, most maps and visualizations created outside of a storytelling framework present only the resolution, obscuring the full story and how the designer came to such a conclusion. 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=KK4Q6FLX))
> In contrast, the designer may choose not to side with any solution, instead leaving the narrative arc unresolved as a cliffhanger, encouraging the audience to ‘fill the gaps’ using their own experiences (Gershon and Page, 2001). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=89&annotation=J6WJ6TQL))
> ‘Without closure, the reader or viewer must become personally involved in the narrative in order to close the gap, in turn energizing the narrative’.

> While foundational, the genres proposed by Segel and Heer (2010) have several limitations restricting practical use for design.

> Static visual stories encapsulate many of Segel and Heer’s(2010) genres based on print design, including magazine style, annotated chart, partitioned poster, flow chart, and comic strip. These sub-genres differ primarily by their mixture of partitioning and annotation. Annotated charts have fluid layouts, with call-out annotation positioned around a central graphic to enforce linearity

> However, the interface for accessing offscreen content is different between the genres: the narrative advances using discrete clicking, tapping, keying, or swiping for dynamic slideshows, rather than continuous scrolling or dragging in longform infographics (Ricker and Roth, 2018). Such interaction gives the designer more control over pacing, limiting skimming by regularizing delivery of plot points.

> Personalized story maps Personalized story maps enforce linearity by the order that an individual contributes content to the story. Personalized story maps collapse the distinction between designer and user – storyteller and audience – inviting non-designers to create visual accounts of their lived experiences and to share these stories collectively through easy-to-use geoweb technologies (Caquard, 2014). 

> [!quote|yellow] ([page. 97](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V4FYUCEA?page=97&annotation=6SUZESBP))
> Non-experts can create visual stories in any genre, and, as stated above, barriers to using new media and geoweb technology are continuing to decrease. However, the personalized story maps genre tends to be defined by a simplified, fluid layout with a central slippy map displaying georeferenced point symbols for interactive access to all content.

> Compilations Finally, compilations enforce linearity through unfolding events in near real-time or major updates to the design. Pioneered by The New York Times as ‘map stacks’ (Wallace, 2018), compilations provide a ‘visual abstract’ often with a link to other story content (visual or non-visual) and stack the visual abstracts vertically or in a grid for rapid browsing.

Prior to the twentieth-century Western push for objectivity, cartographers used stories from the field to ‘fill in the blanks on their maps’ (Caquard, 2013: 136). Accordingly, voice is a primary way in which storytelling can be reintegrated into cartographic design.
