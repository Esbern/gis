Welcome to my digital garden of **[[GIS]]** and other geospatial technologies. This digital garden is a public web-based semi-curated view of my personal notes on these technologies. Some notes are created as learning resources entirely with the purpose of sharing knowledge, while others are primarily created as part of my [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).

In this garden, I’ve taken a novel approach to organising information, reflecting the evolving nature of [[GIS]] and the diverse ways [[GIS project]]s can be implemented. Here's a brief overview of how the garden is structured:

### **Organising the GIS Digital Garden**

1. **Processing Environments
   - **UI-based processing environments**: Products like **[[QGIS]]**, **[[ArcGIS]]**, and **[[GRASS GIS]]** are categorised as **GUI-based processing environments** in this garden. These environments provide a comprehensive suite of tools for geospatial data analysis, visualisation, and management, built on top of powerful Geospatial Processing Ecosystems. They offer a consistent, user-friendly **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** that makes complex geospatial operations accessible to a wide audience.
   - **Programming-First Processing Environments**:
     **JupyterLab as a GIS Processing Environment**: Beyond traditional GUI-driven environments, GIS projects can also be organized around a **programming-first approach** using tools like **JupyterLab**. JupyterLab provides a flexible, interactive environment where geospatial analysis can be conducted through code, leveraging the full power of programming languages like Python, using a **geospatial library ecosystem**.
   
3. **Geospatial Processing Ecosystems**: The backbone of any [[GIS]] lies in the geospatial processing ecosystem, a collection of tools, libraries, and services that manage the heavy lifting of geospatial data analysis. This garden explores various ecosystems, from tightly integrated platforms like **ArcGIS Pro** and **QGIS** to specialized libraries like **GDAL** and service-based systems like **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**. Whether you are working with desktop software or cloud-based services, understanding these ecosystems is key to effectively leveraging the power of geospatial technologies.
   
4. **GIS and GIS Projects**:
   - **GIS (Geographic Information System)**: Here, a GIS is defined as **a collection of tools—typically computer-based—focused on collecting, analyzing, visualizing, storing, editing, and managing geospatial data**.
   - **GIS Project**: A **GIS project** is more than just the software. It’s a structured endeavor that encompasses goals, methods, data, and tools, operating within an **organizational framework** to achieve specific objectives.
