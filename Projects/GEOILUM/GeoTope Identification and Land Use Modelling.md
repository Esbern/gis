GEOILUM (GEOtope Identification and LandUse Modelling) is the overall application name for the Project.
The project consists of two main elements.  
- The Geotope identification
- The Landuse moddeling
Each of the elements has its own complex structure of processing steps. there are, however, some overall principles guiding the design of the project. The goal of these principles is primarily to ensure that the model can be shared and can be set up in different environments with minimal effort. We, therefore, try to build with containerised environments and licences that can be freely distributed. We are at the same time working on a service-based solution where organisations can rent processing time.
The main products used are
- Docker images for containerisation
- [[PostgreSQL]] for backend database services.
- GDAL, Whitbox Geospatial and GRASS for programmatic geoprocessing
- Python and Jupyter Labs for the programming environment
- QGIS for GIS frontend.
