 CityGML is primaraly a semantic urban model (ontology) the purpoes is to ensure interchangability but also e facilitate commen applications that kno the the semantics is consistand  the bas semantic s can be pigiy backed by extended semantics 
 
 The semantic model also contains relations tha in typical GIS would be gnneratet from the geomatry. byt due to the complexity of 3D and the fact that the geomatry often is far from perfect theas relations are explecitly incoded.
 It is the object (cityobject) that is the key and geomatry is a property like all others therfor ther can be seveal geomatries to the same object
 Each geometry can also have several  texture (in city gml named theme) Night daty or inferred etc
 You don not need to implementall aspects of the city gml
